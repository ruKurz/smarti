= Smarti

Smarti is a service component for conversational data. It allows to classify conversation intents, extract entities using
natural language components and makes this data actionable via turning it into queries for an extendable set of endpoints.
In addition Smarti is able to store conversations and thus suggest similar historic conversation flows for new messages.

== How to install

Installation packages are provided for https://www.debian.org[Debian]- and https://www.redhat.com[RedHat]-based systems. Alternatively the application can
be started by directly launching the executable jar. Check out a detailed link:docs/installation.adoc[installation description] including system requirements.

== How to integrate

Currently Smarti is working with https://rocket.chat[Rocket.Chat] conversations, where it can be smoothly integrated via a https://github.com/mrsimpson/Rocket.Chat[RC plugin].
Lookup the link:docs/integrations/rocketchat.adoc[Rocket.Chat plugin description] for further information.

== How to contribution

Smarti is an Open Source project so everyone is encouraged to improve it. Don't hesitate to report bugs, provide fixes or
share new ideas with us. We have various ways for contribution:

* use the issue tracker - report bugs, suggest features or give hints how we can improve the documentation.
